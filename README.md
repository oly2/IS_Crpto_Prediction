The prediction process starts from acquiring the price dataset for BTC and ETH. 
Then I trained models, predicted the close price and lastly compared the performance of the models using RMSE, MAE.

The analyzed dataset was collected from two popular certified kaggle dataset. They provide BTC and ETH price data. 
The recorded prices in the dataset were collected on a minute basis from 29 April 2019 to 29 April 2022. 
In this research, I used time-series data with 1578239 records respectively.
